## Steps

*Ref 1: Understanding the UI that IT/Help Desk Analyst would use daily*

You'll see something like a portal page for you and then a customer also have some sort of form . Once a customer opens a ticket incident or a request, click on it and then there's going to be templates available. What you should focus on for the ticketing system is what you're going to get and how youre' going to assign things. So you'll probably see incident assigned to your or your team like four or five or unassigned tasks. Your main job in the morning or whatever timing your shift starts, you'll want to focus on the unassigned incidents tile.

*Ref 2: Open the drop down menu on the left to reveal more*

If we click on the left side we'll see other stuff like interactions, requests, catalog task, incidents, problems, changes, task, CMDB, and knowledge. Depending on what your company has in process they may say we want the problems to be assigned in a specifc way like if its a problem with some sort of equipment then the client already has some sort of form that they will fill out and it will automatically come to the problem. 

If it's an incident then it's going to come to incident, if it's some sort of request, for ex. "I need a software installation" request or something, this will show under request.

We do this to stay organized or else everything will be a mess and nobody will know what to do and what's the priority and how do we assign these calls and all that stuff.

Main focus should be request, incidents and problems tab. Be familar with them.

*Ref 3-4: Open requests - addressing a sample open ticket*

Let's go to open requests for example. So for example, open request has an request for systems administrator open by system
administrator approved. 

Open the request and get yourself familiar with these boxes, these different types of things like for example:
numbers, REQ0000001, in most of the companies ticket when people say what is the ticket number, they will have some sort of number associated with that ticket so you need to know what to share or waht to look for.

Now if its open or close, check the opened box and it'll give you all the information 

"Request for" - is important because if it's your team and you're the one who's going to assign calls to other team members based on what you're seeing on the drop down menu screen, you got to know that from just learning that information in your company. If you're new to the company, find out how many IT departments are available, who are the power users, go to the member's portal to find out who's in what team and who does what because knowing this early will make you more efficient. Most of the time you'll have someone shadowing you so he or she will tell you who to pick, but if there's no one around it's best to be prepared. 

Once we know where the request is going then we'll input that into the "location" field. Be as descriptive as possible in the description field. Upper managerment like to record data and having a detailed description helps. And don't forget to add a comment.

*Ref 5-6: Addressing a problem*

Since there's no problem assigned to you at the moment, go ahead and make one up by clicking the "new" button on the right. For our example we'll give the problem statement as "My computer has a virus" and a description of "abcd". As you can tell on the right, it gives you helpful articles that you can quickly add to the ticket if you want. The Agent Assist can tailor the description to best fit.

Impact and Urgency drop down menu proves you with the options of 1 - High, 2 - Medium and 3 - Low. Understanding the priorities and assigning the correct level is crucial for the teams that will be responsing to these problems. Then for assignment group, if you know who to assign this problem to from earlier then it'll make things easier. Since this is a security issue then we'll go ahead and assign this to "IT Securities" and click save. Now we have a ticket saved, PRB0040002, and if we go to open problems you'll see your ticket show up as an open problem.

*Ref 7: Using the resolved problems section to our advantage*

If we look into the resolved problems, you'll see what tickets the company has resolved and in there it tells you quality information, to see how they were resolved in a specific area. You can see what the issue is, who assigned, what area the problem was assigned to and how it was resolved. Good place to learn technical skills in the beginning.

*Ref 8-10: Creating a knowledge base*

Go to the knowledge section and click on all articles. From there click "new" and create your own article. For example, our knowledge base is "IT" and article template is "standard", then click "create". Then add a "short description" and create an article.
